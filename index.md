Troels Henriksen's website
================================

[athas@sigkill.dk](mailto:athas@sigkill.dk) [gpg](/pubkey.asc) [ssh](/id_rsa.pub)

Welcome to my website.  My name is Troels Henriksen, and I am a Danish
hacker ([more about me][1]) and general enthusiast in all matters
computing.  I am presently working as a postdoctoral researcher at
[DIKU][diku], the computing department at the University of
Copenhagen, where I do research into optimising compilers for
data-parallel languages.  Concretely, I am working on [the Futhark
language and compiler][futhark].

On this site I present [programs I have written][2], my [configuration
files][3], and [minor scripts][4] that may of some amusement to
others.  I also have a [blog][5], which I may update from time to
time.  I tend to create categories before content (mirroring my
interest in type theory), so parts of the site may seem skeletal.
Please excuse any pompous introductions for folders containing naught
but a five-line shell script.

For those curious about technical details, this site is statically
generated via the nifty Hakyll framework, although it used to be
written in shell script via the pretty good [werc anti-framework][6].
The source code is available [here][sigkillsource].

In case all this is too boring for you, why not check out
[topDatamat][7]?  It's a Danish (English subtitles) sketch show, sort
of inspired by Top Gear, that we film in the basement under the
department of computer science at the University of Copenhagen.  I'm
involved as writer and (very poor) actor.
